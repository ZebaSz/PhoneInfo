# PhoneInfo - An experimental Android project

The idea behind PhoneInfo is to provide a simple playground for new or diverse technologies.

The app itself is simple: it displays some basic information about your device, plus a list of every package installed in it.

*You're currently in the `master` branch.* This branch was implemented with Android Studio 3.0 Canary with Kotlin support. All classes provided are written in Kotlin.
