# PhoneInfo - An experimental Android project

The idea behind PhoneInfo is to provide a simple playground for new or diverse technologies.

The app itself is simple: it displays some basic information about your device, plus a list of every package installed in it.

*You're currently in the `java` branch.* This branch was implemented using standard Java and Android classes available in Android Studio 2.3. However, it was implemented with 3.0 Canary, and as such might not work properly in previous versions.
