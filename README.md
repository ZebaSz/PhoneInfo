# PhoneInfo - An experimental Android project

The idea behind PhoneInfo is to provide a simple playground for new or diverse technologies.

The app itself is simple: it displays some basic information about your device, plus a list of every package installed in it.

*You're currently in the `java-annot` branch.* In addition to using standard Java and Android classes available in Android Studio 2.3, it includes an annotation processor for generation Parcelable classes. As with the `java`branch it was implemented with 3.0 Canary, and as such might not work properly in previous versions.
