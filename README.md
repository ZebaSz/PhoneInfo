# PhoneInfo - An experimental Android project

The idea behind PhoneInfo is to provide a simple playground for new or diverse technologies.

The app itself is simple: it displays some basic information about your device, plus a list of every package installed in it.

*You're currently in the `Litho` branch.* This branch was implemented with Android Studio 3.0 Canary with Kotlin support, using the Litho library for all UI object. All classes provided are written in Kotlin. No layout XML files are included.
