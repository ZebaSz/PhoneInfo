# PhoneInfo - An experimental Android project

The idea behind PhoneInfo is to provide a simple playground for new or diverse technologies.

The app itself is simple: it displays some basic information about your device,
plus a list of every package installed in it.

*You're currently in the `Coroutines` branch.
This branch used to contain an implementation based on Kotlin Coroutines when the API was still unstable.

Since then Coroutines have become stable and the recommended method to perform asynchronous tasks.
All Kotlin-based branches use Coroutines unless otherwise specified.

This branch is now empty and exists solely for archival purposes.
